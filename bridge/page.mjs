/**
 * Showing a web page on the display.
 *
 * The problem this solves is specific and, until now, unsolvable from the
 * browser side. JARVIS finds an article and wants to put it on screen. Three
 * separate mechanisms stop him:
 *
 *   1. `X-Frame-Options: DENY` / `frame-ancestors` — most publishers refuse to
 *      be framed at all, so an <iframe> pointed at the article is a blank box.
 *   2. CORS — the page cannot fetch the article's HTML to render it itself.
 *   3. Hotlink blocking — even the images inside it 403 for anything that is
 *      not the publisher's own page.
 *
 * All three are the *origin server's* rules about who may load its content, and
 * all three are enforced against the browser. So we take the browser out of it.
 * The bridge fetches the document server-side and serves it back from
 * http://localhost:8787, and at that point the page in the iframe is, as far as
 * the browser is concerned, ours. There is no cross-origin request to refuse, no
 * frame-ancestors to violate, and no CORS preflight to fail. The publisher's
 * headers are not bypassed so much as made irrelevant — they were never about
 * this machine reading the article, which is a thing the user is entitled to do.
 *
 * Two modes, because "show me the article" means two different things:
 *
 *   reader — the words, restyled into this interface. Always legible, never
 *            looks like the source. Nothing loads from the publisher at all;
 *            even the images come back through the bridge's own /img.
 *   live   — the real page, scripts removed. Looks like the site, because
 *            sometimes the layout IS the information. Its own stylesheets and
 *            images load from the publisher, so this mode does tell the
 *            publisher that somebody read it — which is exactly as true as it
 *            would be if the user had opened the tab themselves.
 */

/**
 * The one script allowed to run inside a proxied page.
 *
 * A blade shows articles in an iframe, and an iframe is its own document — the
 * parent cannot scroll it, cannot reach into it, and must not be able to. That
 * is correct for safety and inconvenient for reading: a hand has no scroll
 * wheel, so without a channel the only way through a long article is a mouse.
 *
 * So the page gets one listener, injected by us, that scrolls on request and
 * does nothing else. It is admitted by nonce rather than by 'unsafe-inline', so
 * this exact script runs and anything the publisher shipped does not — and the
 * frame is sandboxed WITHOUT allow-same-origin, so the script executes in an
 * opaque origin that cannot touch this application even though it can move its
 * own scroll position.
