 * This is JARVIS's shelf: a screenshot he has just taken, a still he generated,
 * the cover of whatever is playing. Each one is a camera-facing plane carried
 * round a tilted circle, which is enough to read as an orbit without any of the
 * cost of real 3D — no lighting, no shadows, no depth sorting to fight.
 *
 * Not one element in here is React. The list changes whenever JARVIS adds or
 * drops an object, and expressing that as JSX would put mounts and unmounts of
 * scene objects on the React render path — the exact thing the Drive object in
 * Scene.tsx exists to avoid, and worse here, because a re-render of this subtree
 * would drop and rebuild every texture in it. So the group is built by hand and
 * reconciled inside useFrame; the steady-state cost of that is one pointer
 * comparison per frame, because the store hands back the same array identity
 * until the list genuinely changes.
