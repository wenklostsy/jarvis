 *
 * Only real disk paths qualify. Rewriting every src beginning with a slash also
 * caught the app's own assets, so `<img src="/vite.svg">` turned into a read of
 * `/vite.svg` on the host, 404'd, and rendered as 'image unavailable'.
 *
 * `/img` and `/media` — remote http(s) sources, proxied rather than refused. The
 * browser still only ever talks to localhost, which is what lets the page CSP
 * stay closed and stops markup that summarises an untrusted web page from
 * beaconing this machine's address to a host the model was told to use. It also
 * gets the bytes at all: news sites and image CDNs routinely block hotlinking.
