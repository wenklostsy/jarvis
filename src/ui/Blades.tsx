/**
 * The blades.
 *
 * This file used to be six slivers of light raking across the frame while a
 * tool ran — pure atmosphere, nothing you could read. That effect is still
 * here, at the bottom, because it is still the right answer to "something is
 * happening". But the name now belongs to the surface it was decorating.
 *
 * A panel is a card you glance at while listening: a figure, three headlines, a
 * status line. A blade is the thing you actually look at. The distinction is
 * not styling, it is geometry — an article you are meant to READ needs a column
 * of a particular width and a height you can scroll, and no amount of care
 * makes that work inside a 320px card stacked beside the reactor. So blades own
 * their size, they stack instead of replacing one another, and the user can
 * pull an older one forward or throw one to full screen.
 *
 * The hard problem a blade solves is that most of the web refuses to be shown.
 * X-Frame-Options and frame-ancestors stop an article being framed, CORS stops
 * the page fetching it, and hotlink protection stops even its images loading.
 * All three are rules the origin server enforces against the *browser*, so the
 * bridge takes the browser out of it: it fetches server-side and serves the
 * result from localhost, and at that point the document in the iframe is ours.
 *
 * Nothing in this file is a special case for a particular site, and nothing
 * here sniffs a file extension. The model asks `probe_url` what a thing is and
 * says what it wants shown; this only knows how to show it.
