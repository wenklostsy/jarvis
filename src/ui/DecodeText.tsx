/**
 * JARVIS's lines, arriving the way a computer would produce them.
 *
 * The hard part is not the effect, it is that the text underneath is *live*.
 * The store appends a token at a time, so this component re-renders dozens of
 * times a second with a slightly longer string, and the naive implementation —
 * scramble the whole thing, resolve it over N milliseconds — restarts the
 * animation on every token and never finishes decoding anything.
 *
 * So the frontier is a ref and only ever moves forward. Everything behind it
 * has settled and is plain text that will never animate again; a short window
 * ahead of it is noise; the rest is present in the DOM but invisible, which
 * keeps the line wrapping identical to the finished paragraph and means the
 * accessibility tree always holds the real sentence. The rate scales with how
 * far behind the frontier has fallen, so a single token drips and a 300
 * character burst clears inside MAX_LAG_MS — the decode must never be the
 * reason the transcript trails the voice.
 *
 * The rAF loop repaints on a 42ms gate rather than every frame, and stops dead
 * the moment the frontier catches up.
