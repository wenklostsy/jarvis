 * Picks the brain. Both backends answer a question and stream text and tool
 * events back; they differ in where they run and what they can reach.
 *
 *   bridge — a local Node process running the Claude Agent SDK. Uses your
 *            existing Claude Code login, so no API key, and every MCP server
 *            you have configured is available, including local stdio ones.
 *
 *   direct — the browser calls the Claude API itself. No process to run and it
 *            deploys as a static site, but it needs an API key in the bundle
 *            and can only use remote HTTP MCP servers.
