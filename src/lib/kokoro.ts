/**
 * Neural speech, entirely in the browser.
 *
 * `speechSynthesis` is limited to whatever voices the operating system ships,
 * and on macOS the British male option is Daniel — a compact concatenative
 * voice from over a decade ago. It is the honest ceiling of the built-in API
 * and it sounds like a satnav.
 *
 * Kokoro is an 82M-parameter TTS model that runs on WebGPU via ONNX. No cloud,
 * no API key, nothing leaves the machine — but it sounds like a person. It
 * carries four British male voices, which is what this project actually wants.
 *
 * The cost is a one-time ~86MB model download, cached by the browser
 * afterwards. It's fetched during the boot sequence so the first "Hey Jarvis"
 * isn't waiting on it, and anything that goes wrong falls back to Daniel.
