/**
 * Filler speech.
 *
 * A tool call can take ten seconds, and silence that long reads as a crash. So
 * JARVIS says something the instant work starts — then goes quiet until he has
 * an answer. One acknowledgement, no progress chatter.
 *
 * The phrasing follows the character's actual grammar rather than generic
 * assistant-speak, which matters more than it sounds:
 *
 *   - Working lines are subjectless present participles: "Compiling.",
 *     "Cross-referencing." Not "I'm now checking" and never "let me".
 *   - There is no snap-to compliance formula. "Right away" and "At once" are
 *     not in his vocabulary; acknowledgement is deferential, not eager.
 *   - No filler words, no enthusiasm, no apology, no exclamation marks.
 *   - "Sir" fronted means urgency; final means routine. These are all routine,
 *     so it goes at the end, and only sometimes.

 * for. Matching one flat substring against the whole string gets both wrong —
 * `mcp__playwright__browser_click` announced a web search because "browse"
 * appeared earlier in the table than "browser", `Get-Report` looked like a code
 * repository, `Get-Events` like a calendar entry, and "highlight" like a lamp.
 *
 * So: split the name, match the halves separately, order the table so the
 * specific beats the general, and put word boundaries on the short words that
 * hide inside longer ones. Either half matching is enough — the server is the
 * better signal when a name gives one, but plenty of them don't.
